## Description
This is a typing test TUI. I have used MonkeyType's WPM algorithm for calulcating the words per minute. 
Users are able to do a quick test, which is a timed 15 second test, do a test with a specific number of words, or a timed test of 15s, 30s, 60s. 


### Executing program

* Use cargo run or cargo build, cargo run if you just want to tinker and do a test and cargo build if you would like the binary
